Firstly, turning cpp code into something the pcio executes:
1 - Open terminal in the project folder, same as the cpp file
2 - mkdir build
3 - cd build
4 - cmake ..
5 - make
6 - inside the build folder, a .uf2 file is created
7 - upload the uf2 to the pico using its bootloader


To read the print statements from the pico

minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyACM0
